<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Wouldn't it be great if you could quickly see how climate and environmental changes are evolving in different locations through time? If this sounds like you, then you are on the right place. Using NASA's open source datasets and virtual globe API we provide a simple tool for looking around Earth in an instant. And it's not even 400 lines of code, so feel free to modify it to your taste to visualise what matters most to you!

### Built with

* [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [Web WorldWind](https://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/)
* [NEO: Nasa Earth Observations](https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/)


## Usage

Just spin around the globe by dragging it with the left mouse click or scrolling to get closer. The world is in your hands now!

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap


See the [Project Board](https://github.com/fgtoralesch/throughspaceandtime/projects/1) for a list of proposed features (and known issues).<br>
The major aspects are:<br>
  -Add a searchbar for Locations, so you are able to find your the location you're intersted in faster.<br>
  -Add a searchbar for datasets, so you can find the data you need.<br>
  -Add a timeline for better visualistaion of changes between datasets.<br>
  -Improve the overal usibility and experience.<br>

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->

We specially started working in this project to let people know about the availabe data out there, but more importantly to encourage others to make it work in a weekend if they wanted to. So obviously any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
